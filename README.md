# traefigit

Use GIT workflow and continuous integration to maintain your traefik rules.

## Usage

- Edit `mappings.json` with a Pull request
- Once merged, it will be applied

The `mappings.json` is a simplified version of the [traefik REST syntax](https://docs.traefik.io/configuration/backends/rest/)
